# FastAPILearning
I am learning FastAPI the web interface for python and wish to document my journey through Github.

#### NOTE
- learning.ipynb file is a personal reference file for me to keep track of my learning process.
- i am referring to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t2alSnE2-I&t=1277s for the learning process (primarily)
- after this i will continue to refer to the official fastapi documentation for further learning and tracking using the ipynb file
- the main file will solely be for the application and will only be used once i am in the project building phase
- the main file as of now is just for learning purpose so the code may not be structured or might have redundant code
